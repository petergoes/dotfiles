# Dotfiles

My dotfiles.

To setup the tools I want to have available on a new Mac.

It will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) first and then use that to install various tools

## Usage

Please review the script before running it. ⚠️

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petergoes/dotfiles/main/script/download.sh)"
```

## Ubuntu 

I am in the process of using this repo for Ubuntu as well. Most of the scripts
under `./script` will not work because is all assumes mac os. But how knows,
someday this might work
